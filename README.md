# Todo List

## Description

Todo List is a **full-stack CRUD application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This application allows users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** (CRUD) their tasks. Users can add tasks, track their progress, and manage their to-do items efficiently.

This project serves as a practical example of implementing the MERN stack for full-stack development, making it a great learning resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Features

- âœ… **Add tasks** to the to-do list
- âœ… **View** all added tasks
- âœ… **Update** task details and status
- âœ… **Delete** completed or unnecessary tasks
- âœ… **RESTful API** for seamless frontend-backend communication
- âœ… **Responsive UI** for an intuitive user experience

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend:**
- React.js
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- React Icons
- FontAwesome Icons
- React Hot Toast

### **Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Body-Parser
- CORS
- Dotenv
- Nodemon (for development)

## Getting Started

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
   cd todo-list
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
